The Single Responsibility Principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software. 
“Do one thing and do it well”. This quote refers to the single responsibility principle. It concludes that a class or module must have only one reason to change.

This following piece of code violates the Single Responsibility principle as CreatePost method has too many responsibilities. 

class User
{
    void CreatePost(Database db, string postMessage)
    {
        try
        {
            db.Add(postMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            db.LogError("An error occured: ", ex.ToString());
            File.WriteAllText("\LocalErrors.txt", ex.ToString());
        }
    }
}

This is the corrected code below which maintains the Single responsibility principle.

class Post
{
    private ErrorLogger errorLogger = new ErrorLogger();

    void CreatePost(Database db, string postMessage)
    {
        try
        {
            db.Add(postMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            errorLogger.log(ex.ToString())
        }
    }
}

class ErrorLogger
{
    void log(string error)
    {
      db.LogError("An error occured: ", error);
      File.WriteAllText("\LocalErrors.txt", error);
    }
}

Now we have two classes that each has one responsibility; to create a post and to log an error, respectively.
