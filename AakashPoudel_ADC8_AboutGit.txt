Git clone:

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.

Git push:

Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.

Merge conflict:

Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

Git branches:

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master.

Git commits:

The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
